        <h1 class="mt-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-white">Why Hop Easy Link exists</h1>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-lg text-white/70">
            Hop Easy Link is the refreshed hel.ink studio built for teams who want
            a transparent alternative to commercial link platforms. We focus on clean redirects,
            privacy-aware analytics, and tooling that stays fast on modest infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-6 max-w-3xl text-base text-white/70">Our platform helps teams of any size manage campaigns, share resources, and measure engagement without exposing user data to third-party trackers. We prioritise reliability and predictable pricing, and provide features such as custom domains, link expiration, password-protected links, and branded previews to suit modern marketing workflows.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base text-white/70">Hel.ink is designed for developers and non-technical users alike — with a simple dashboard for everyday tasks and an API for automation. Whether you need short, memorable URLs for social posts or detailed click analytics for product launches, Hop Easy Link keeps the process simple and auditable.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="text-white/70">We believe URL shortening should be transparent, accessible, and user-friendly. Too many platforms hide features behind paywalls or track users without consent. HEL.ink was created to offer a better way: open-source foundations, clear documentation, and a commitment to data privacy. Whether you're an individual creator, a startup, or an enterprise, you deserve tools that respect your audience and give you full control over your links.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold text-white">What Makes Us Different</h2>
            <p class="text-white/70">Unlike traditional link shorteners that monetize through ads or data resale, HEL.ink operates on a straightforward model: provide excellent service, respect user privacy, and maintain transparent operations. Our infrastructure is optimized for performance without bloat, ensuring fast redirects even under heavy traffic. We don't inject scripts into your destination pages, and we never share your analytics data with third parties.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Built for Growth</h2>
            <p class="text-white/70">From day one, we designed HEL.ink to scale with your needs. Start with basic link shortening, then add folders and tags as your library grows. Need advanced features like custom QR codes, password protection, or link expiration? They're all included. Our analytics dashboard grows with you too, offering detailed insights into click patterns, geographic distribution, device types, and referral sources—all without complicated setup or hidden costs.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Community & Support</h2>
            <p class="text-white/70">We're committed to building not just a tool, but a community. Whether you're self-hosting HEL.ink on your own server or using our hosted service, you'll find comprehensive documentation, responsive support, and a growing ecosystem of integrations. Have a feature request? We listen. Found a bug? We fix it. Want to contribute? We welcome collaboration. HEL.ink is built by users, for users.</p>
